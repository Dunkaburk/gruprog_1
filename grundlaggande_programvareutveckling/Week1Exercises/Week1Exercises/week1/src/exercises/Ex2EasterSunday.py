def when_is_easter_sunday_program():
    # int a, b, c, d, e, s, t   // Avoid variables on same line (but acceptable here)
    # int date;
    #        int year;
    #        int month = 0;
    # ---- Input --------------
    year = int(input("Input a year (1900-2099) > "))

    # ----- Process -----------
    a = year % 19  # Don't need to understand, Gauss did understand
    b = year % 4
    c = year % 7
    s = 19 * a + 24
    d = s % 30
    t = 2 * b + 4 * c + 6 * d + 5
    e = t % 7
    date = 22 + d + e

    # TODO Now you continue ...
    #  If date is less than 32, then date is found and month is march.
    #  Else: Date is set to d + e - 9 and month is april ...
    #  ... but with two exceptions
    #  If date is 26 easter is on 19 of april.
    #  If date is 25 and a = 16 and d = 28 then date is 18 of april.

    if date < 32 and date!=26 and date!=25:
        month = "march"
        

    elif date == 26:
        month = "april"
        date = 26

    elif date == 25 and a == 16 and d == 28:
        month = "april"
        date = 18

    else:
        month = "april"
        date = d + e - 9

    # --------- Output -----------
    print("Easter Sunday for " + str(year) + " is : " + str(date) + "/" + str(month))
